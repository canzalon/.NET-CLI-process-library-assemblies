.NET-CLI-process-library-assemblies
===================================
The projects in this solution demonstrate some of the basic LINQ with C# capabilities of the .NET framework. Additionally, they exercise the component-based ability of a .NET assembly to be made up of multiple modules. 

It involves writing three projects, two of which contain a class library project and console application project. The other project contains no library assemblies (DLLs), just a console application. The two projects with the library assemblies exercise the ability of a .NET assembly to be made up of multiple modules (code files). Extensive, specific information is included in the assignment file (assig2.doc) and in the comments in the code files.
